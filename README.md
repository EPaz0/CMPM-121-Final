# CMPM-121-Final

# Devlog Entry - 11/13/24
## Introducing the team

Tools Lead: Enrique Paz
Engine Lead: Raul Mojarro
Design Lead: Lyle Watkins



## Tools and materials
We are going to be using typescript and baseline web platforms because they are things we have been using and are class and familiar to us right now. We will be using VSCode for our IDE because itâ€™s easy to use and we are most familiar with it. Lyle will use Procreate to create visual assets because it has a built-in animation editor and they have been using it for years. Our alternate platform choice is PixieJS and we chose it because we don't like Phaser and want to try something new.


## Outlook
One thing we anticipate being a hard part of the project is setting up our game visually while using HTML. Also, another thing we anticipate being hard/risky is having our game break during the switch if there is one. We are hoping to learn how to use our alternate platform PixieJS and also learn how to create a game without an engine.
